Software developer based near Rotterdam and Breda, the Netherlands. Originally trained as a multimedia designer and critical thinker at Avans University of Applied Sciences in Breda. My interests lie in the field of front-end development and creative technologies, and my main goal is to become better at being a creative developer by working on cool challenging projects.
