					At an early age I always longed to go back home during the holidays, because thatâ€™s where the computer
					was. I had the drive to create something every single day. Fortunately, the world is different now, and
					computers are portable. Along the road I gradually gained a full pallet of designing and developing
					expertise which I still use every day. The majority of people I have met refer to me as a digital wizard.
					I proudly call myself a creative developer.
