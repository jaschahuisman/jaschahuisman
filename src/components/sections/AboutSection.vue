        At an early age I always longed to go back home during the holidays, because thatâ€™s where the computer was. I
        had the drive to create something every single day. Fortunately, the world is different now, and computers are
        portable. Along the road I gradually gained a full pallet of designing and developing expertise which I still
        use every day. The majority of people I have met refer to me as a digital wizard. I proudly call myself a
        creative developer.
