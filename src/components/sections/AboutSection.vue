        At an early age I always longed to go back home during the holidays,
        because thatâ€™s where the computer was. I had the drive to create
        something every single day. Fortunately, the world is different now, and
        computers are portable. Along the road I gradually gained a full pallet
        of designing and developing expertise which I still use every day. The
        majority of people I have met refer to me as a digital wizard. I proudly
        call myself a creative developer.
