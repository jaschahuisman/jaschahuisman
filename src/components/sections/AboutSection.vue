      At an early age I always longed to go back home during the holidays,
      because thatâ€™s where the computer was. I had the drive to create something
      every single day. Fortunately, the world is different now, and computers
      are portable. Along the road I gradually gained a full pallet of designing
      and developing expertise which I still use every day. The majority of
      people I have met refer to me as a digital wizard. I proudly call myself a
      creative developer.
